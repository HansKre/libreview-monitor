### Manual Installation (Development)

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HansKre/libreview-monitor.git
   cd libreview-monitor
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build the extension:**

## 🔧 Development

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build extension for production
npm run build:extension

# Build extension with development mode and file watching
npm run build:extension:dev

# Lint TypeScript/TSX files
npm run lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix
```

### Architecture Overview

- **Service Worker** (`background.ts`) - Handles API calls, data persistence, and icon updates
- **React Popup** (`popup.tsx`) - Interactive chart interface with glucose projections
- **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript coverage with shared interfaces
- **Chrome APIs** - Storage, Alarms, and Action APIs for reliable functionality

### Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Recharts
- **Build**: Webpack 5 with Chrome Extension optimization
- **APIs**: LibreView REST API integration
- **Storage**: Chrome Storage API with encryption

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- **No data collection**: Your glucose data stays on your device and goes directly to LibreView
- **Secure storage**: Credentials encrypted using Chrome's built-in storage APIs
- **HTTPS only**: All API communications use secure connections
- **No tracking**: Extension doesn't track usage or personal information
- **Open source**: Full source code available for security review

## 📊 How It Works

### Data Flow

1. **Authentication**: Secure login to LibreView API using your FreeStyle LibreLink credentials
2. **Data Fetching**: Background service worker fetches glucose data every minute
3. **Icon Updates**: Browser icon updates with current glucose value and color coding
4. **Trend Analysis**: Linear regression calculates 60-minute glucose projections
5. **Visualization**: Interactive charts display actual and projected glucose trends

### Glucose Projection Algorithm

- Analyzes the last 30 minutes of glucose data
- Uses simple linear regression for trend calculation
- Generates 5-minute interval projections up to 60 minutes ahead
- Applies conservative bounds (40-400 mg/dL) for medical safety

## 🆘 Support & FAQ

**Q: My glucose data isn't updating**

- Verify your LibreView credentials are correct
- Check that you have an active FreeStyle Libre sensor
- Ensure the extension has permission to access LibreView API

**Q: The browser icon shows "?" or is blank**

- This indicates no recent glucose data or connection issues
- Try refreshing your credentials in the extension settings
- Check your internet connection

**Q: Are my credentials safe?**

- Yes, credentials are encrypted and stored locally using Chrome's secure storage
- The extension only communicates with official LibreView servers
- No third-party services have access to your data
